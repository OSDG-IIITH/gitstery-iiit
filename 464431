"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home
I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying
with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter
and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It
brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before
whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr.
Hosmer Angel."
