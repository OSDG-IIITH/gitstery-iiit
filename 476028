"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember
the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to
affect your life."

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs
stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from
the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned
back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite
languor in his face.
