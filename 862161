affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing
some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so
much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
