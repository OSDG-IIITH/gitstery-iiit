"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I
should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
official police."

"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would take
the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an
introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do
you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
