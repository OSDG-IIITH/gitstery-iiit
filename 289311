"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured
me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

"'Stolen!' he cried.

"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?
Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'

"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say
another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the
morning and make my own way in the world.'
