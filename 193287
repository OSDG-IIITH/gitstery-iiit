"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a
woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have
driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon
your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since
we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.  "You may rely upon my doing all that
I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some
flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."
