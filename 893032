But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile
alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London
Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a
black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to
wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and
by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long,
low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.

Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed
shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red
circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the
metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a
strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off
into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-
legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his
elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
