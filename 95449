We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door
flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran
forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such
trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.  How you startled me, Kate! I had not
an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were in
grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably
and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two
days. I am so frightened about him!"
