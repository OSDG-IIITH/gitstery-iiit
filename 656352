barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of
cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel
abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the
newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the
plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was
nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at
the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I
have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks,
all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
