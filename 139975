"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent.
Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in a prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds
you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I
suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that
my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
